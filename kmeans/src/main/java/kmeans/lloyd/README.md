# Lloyd's KMeans Algorithm

Lloyd' Algorithm is a clustering algorithm that segments data points into clusters based on their distance.

Pseudo-code:

```
function lloyd(inputData, clusters):
  while the clusters change:
    Assign each point to its closest cluster center

    Assign each cluster center to the average of its points
```
